Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.
Oscar While
In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on.
Robert Frost
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So
throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.
H. Jackson Brown Jr.
Love is the ultimate outlaw. It just won't adhere to any rules. The most any of us can do is to sign on as its
accomplice. Instead of vowing to honor and obey, maybe we should swear to aid and abet. That would mean that security is
out of the question. The words "make" and "stay" become inappropriate. My love for you has no strings attached. I love
you for free.
Tom Robbins
If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.
Mark Twain
Without music, life would be a mistake.
Friedrich Nietzsche
